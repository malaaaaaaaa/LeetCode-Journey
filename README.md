# My Leetcode Journey using Python3 &heart;

My codes are not the most best way of solving the problem. This is just for me to keep track on what I did and how I did it

## Plans for this

In order of what I think is important

Try solving and adding solutions with another language (Java or C++)
Add another Column for the difficulty of the Leetcode Problem
